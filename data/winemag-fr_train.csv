6183,"Still young, of course, but already the wine is showing great fruits, smoothed by wood, offering style and sophistication.

327,"What to mention first? A hint of mossy earth, chamomile tisane, Cox Orange Pippin apples or lemon zest? All of these aromas dance on the nose. They are still totally shy on the taut, dry and concentrated palate. For now, it is mossy citrus that is most aromatic while rich fruit still needs to unfurl.

9893,"Normally Ugni Blanc and Colombard grapes are distilled into Cognac or Armagnac, but owner Yves Grassa has chosen to turn these pedestrian varieties into a clean, crisp, dry wine that exudes grapefruit and green-apple characteristics along with a nice smack of herbaceousness.

1397,"Rich and sweetly fruity, this wine wields intense power. Red fruits are initially opulent and pleasurable, but then the wine begins to show solid structure and concentration. The final texture, with its tannins and fruit in harmony, is impressive. Drink from 2018.",Pinot_Noir,1,0,Burgundy

6092,"The pale pink color of this wine is instantly appealing, conjuring up lazy summer days. Made from Pinot Noir, the wine has a smooth, ripe strawberry taste, with just a touch of smoky tannin. Crisp and acidic on the finish. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.",Pinot_Noir,0,0,Alsace

3846,"This seems a tad more restrained than usual for La Doriane, which has typically been extremely lush and exotic in the past. The 2012 isn't as over the top, but still shows plenty of ripe apricot and tropical fruit framed by smoky oak and baking spices. The finish is long and mouthwatering, suggesting at least a few years of longevity.",Viognier,1,0,Rhône_Valley
9460,"To judge by this fresh, crisply fruity example, 2006 is a great year for rosé on the Loire. It has lively raspberry flavors and a great burst of finishing acidity. Delicious.",Cabernet_Franc,0,0,Loire_Valley
758,"Made from a separate parcel of the Valandraud estate, this is a fruity, ripe wine. Dark tannins and flavors of dark chocolate combine with great fruit and acidity. It is still packed with tannins and will take plenty of time to come round. Drink from 2024.",Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend,1,0,Bordeaux
7211,"This richly perfumed wine is firm with tannins, showing its high alcohol through a sharp peppery edge. It is dense and concentrated, almost too much so to pair with food.",Bordeaux-style_Red_Blend,1,0,Bordeaux
2385,"Opens with a stunning layered, bouquet of dried fruits, sandalwood, flowers, smoke and ginger. It's full on the tongue, with rich pear and apple flavors, toast and yeast accents. Citrus and mineral notes persist on the lengthy finish of this impressively complex bottling. Sourced from seven grand cru villages, this is superb now and will last a very long time.",Champagne_Blend,1,1,Champagne

9934,"Supple and easy to drink, this is as good an introduction to Cote-Rotie as any.

With 25,000 cases produced, it's the Cote-Rotie consumers are most likely to find.",Syrah,1,0,Rhône_Valley

4850,"A bit tough and unyielding right now, Nalys's 2008 Châteauneuf-du-Pape displays adequate black cherry fruit and hints of horse stable and garrigue. It does dry out on the finish; drink it up over the next few years.",Rhône-style_Red_Blend,1,0,Rhône_Valley

5807,"With a majority of Chardonnay in the blend, this has turned into a wonderfully expressive wine. It is more open than the great 1996, more generous, giving some mature toast and nut flavors, but still retaining ripe apricots and mulberry. In the Jacquesson style, this is very dry, but its richness keeps it well in balance.",Champagne_Blend,1,1,Champagne

1128,"Concentrated and full, this has serious structure, dense, dry spiciness as well as rich lychee and mango fruit flavors. The minerality brings out the chalk soil of the Zinnkoepflé vineyard, the highest in Alsace. It's a wine for aging, so don't drink before 2018.",Gewürztraminer,1,0,Alsace
5196,"Hecht & Bannier tends to favor a blend based on Syrah and Mourvèdre, here 55% and 35% respectively, with a small addition of Carignan to add lively spice and vibrant acidity. Aromas of rosemary and thyme sprigs spice up the ripe fruit core, while the medium-length finish offers a lovely dusting of black pepper on the end. Drink now–2015.",Rhône-style_Red_Blend,1,0,Languedoc-Roussillon
9865,"A rare rosé made by obtaining the color from the skins of the Pinot during maceration, rather than by adding red wine.

8670,"Made entirely from Grenache Blanc and fortified to 16% alcohol, this is an intriguing dessert wine. After aging in barrel for three years, it's taken on some nutty overtones, yet still retains a perfumed quality and orange-citrus flavors. Probably best with cheeses or on its own.",Grenache_Blanc,1,0,Languedoc-Roussillon
8629,"Intensely perfumed, this wine shows both strength and great elegance. The raspberry flavors float over a light structure of some dry tannins.

8259,"A rich and beautiful wine with a lush, full weight and velvety texture. Typical black fruit abounds with accents of milk chocolate, thyme and eucalyptus. A hint of grapefruit oil adds vibrancy to the nose, transcending a more traditional Corbières offering. The finish is long and lingering but a bit tight with strong tannic presence; drink 2010 on. Only 50 cases imported.",Rhône-style_Red_Blend,1,0,Languedoc-Roussillon
278,"Produced only in top years, this rich wine is impressive. It has great fruit, ripe strawberries and red currants bringing juicy fruitiness.
