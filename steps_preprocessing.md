1- Convert text to lowercase: Convert all the text data in the 'synopsis' and 'title' columns to lowercase to ensure that the same words are not treated differently due to case sensitivity.

2-Remove punctuation and special characters: Remove all the punctuation and special characters from the text data, such as commas, dots, hyphens, brackets, and quotation marks, as they do not contribute to the classification task.

3-Tokenize the text: Tokenize the text data by splitting it into individual words or tokens. This can be done using the split() method in Python.

4-Remove stopwords: Remove common stopwords from the text data such as 'the', 'and', 'is', 'in', and so on, as they do not add much meaning to the text and can cause noise in the classification task. This can be done using the stopwords module in NLTK or by creating a custom list of stopwords.

5-Stemming or Lemmatizing: Stemming and lemmatizing are techniques used to reduce words to their base form. For example, 'running', 'ran', and 'runs' can all be stemmed to 'run', while 'better' and 'best' can be lemmatized to 'good'. This step can be performed using libraries like NLTK or spaCy.

6-Vectorize the text: Convert the preprocessed text data into numerical vectors that can be used as input to machine learning algorithms. There are various techniques for vectorizing text data such as Bag-of-Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and Word Embeddings.

7-Splitting the data into training and testing sets: Finally, after pre-processing and vectorizing the data, the dataset can be split into training and testing sets, which can be used to train and evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms.
